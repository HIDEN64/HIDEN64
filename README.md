# Greetings! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Athena (she/they). I make retro hardware/software do things they were never intended to.

Main things I do these days is develop [WebTV Redialed](https://webtv.zone), [CrossTalk](https://crosstalkim.xyz), and help out with digital signage for [CPC-Computing](https://github.com/CPC-Computing). I'll also contribute to FOSS projects every now and then :P.

You can find most of my repoes on my [Forgejo instance](https://git.hiden.cc/explore/).
